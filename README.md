# Book-Recommendation-System

The Book Recommender System is a web application designed to help users discover new books based on their interests and preferences. It utilizes the Flask framework in Python to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. Here's a more detailed overview of your project:

User Interface:

The application has a clean and responsive user interface, with a black background and white text for high contrast and readability.
The navigation bar at the top provides links to different sections of the site, including the Home page, Recommend page, and Contact page.

Home Page:
The Home page displays the top 50 books in a grid layout, with each book presented in a card format.
Each card includes the book's cover image, title, author, number of votes, and rating.
Users can scroll through the list of books to explore different options.

Recommend Page:
The Recommend page allows users to input their preferences or interests, such as favorite genres or authors.
Based on these preferences, the system recommends books that match the user's interests.
Users can click on the recommended books to view more details and add them to their reading list.
